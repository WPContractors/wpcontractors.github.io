If your website lacks optimization, your audience might get frustrated with page load times. Users and customers have little patience for loading issues or errors.

Google Analytics reports that the most popular queries for website optimization are related to speed and image compression. Entire companies, Quora threads, and blogs are dedicated to questions like: “Why is my website loading slowly?”; and, “How can I boost loading time?”

On WordPress, many of these questions can be mitigated or resolved by installing or updating your WordPress plugins. This means you need to consider what type of plugins to use, and which ones will enhance your speed or performance.

If you’re a beginner, you might not know about WordPress plugins. These handy tools can enhance your website by customizing it, adding special features, and maximizing performance.

What do plugins do? WordPress performance plugins help with:

* Reducing HTTP requests and static CSS
* Turning off the unnecessary running add-ins
* Decreasing back-end load
